# MyFirstJavaApp
A java gui application that takes a string of text as input, capitalizes each word that is greater than 4characters and returns the capitalized version as output

## *src* folder
Within the src/com/flora folder are the two java files where the source code for the application is written.
The Main.java contains the gui code while the TitleCaseConverter.java file contains logic for application

## *out* folder
Within the *out/production* folder, are the compiled version of the .java files
These files are saved with the .class extension, it can be run from windows commandline with `java com.flora.Main` command

Just ensure to be within the folder where the files are.

Within the *out/artifact* folder a .jar file is found which is the packaged version of *MyFirstApp* i.e the packaged and ready to be shipped app.


##
The .iml file is automatically generated by IntelliJ IDEA and contains meta-data

This java aplication is within a package named - entirely by my own discretion as - com.flora
